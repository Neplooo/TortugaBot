# TortugaBot
This is the tortugabot, a custom robot made with the Arduino controller shield and a 4wd robot and sends signals with a NRF24L01 module.

The V1 version is outdated and does not work however, the V2 is finished and will be uploaded to github soon.

The code functions by taking the inputs from the joystick shield and then sending it to the robot across the NRF24, Then the robot sees it and moves depending on how the what the 
values say.
